            Degen Heroes are a collection of 2000 NFT's that live and breathe on
            the blockchain with the primary objective of rewarding the NFT
            space. You'll notice that each Hero is randomly assigned an Element;
            Fire, Water, Earth & Air. Something very special is coming for those
            that hold all 4 elements.
          </p>

            Let’s talk about the real Heroes. Degen Heroes haven’t just been
            designed to look incredible as your profile picture. Your Hero is a
            representation of you, the NFT enthusiast, flipping and hodling your
            way into the Metaverse whilst dodging rug-pulls and cash grabs. You
            deserve real value, real rewards & real community for providing
            liquidity to and being a part of this crazy new world.
